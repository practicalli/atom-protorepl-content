# Proton-mode

[Proton-mode](https://github.com/dvcrn/proton) gives a Spacemacs-like experience to the Atom editor

Proton-mode provides a mnemonic menu and set of keybindings that offer an effective alternative to the interesting keybindings with Atom and ProtoREPL.  It also provides modal editing features, simplifying keybindings.
